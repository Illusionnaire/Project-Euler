//Largest Palindrome Product
//By: Marcin Wisniowski

//A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the 
//product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
//Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. 

//(This makes a 5-6 digit number)
//Currently the code does not correctly work for 5 digit numbers, so it assumes that there will be a bigger 6 digit answer as the biggest palindrome. Will fix later.

#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std;

//Checks for palindrome by comparing biggest and smallest array locations incrementally towards middle
bool checkPalindrome(int palindrome){
    vector<int> product;
    bool test;
    int length = 0;

    //Splits integer into array of digits. This technically mirrors the output, but it doesn't matter when checking.
    while(palindrome > 0){
        product.push_back(palindrome % 10);
        length++;
        palindrome /= 10;
    }

    //If count is odd, it does not have to check the middle value
    for(int i = 0; i< length/2; i++){
        if(product[i] == product[length-1-i]){
            test = true;
